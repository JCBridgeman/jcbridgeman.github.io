Each volume forms a 2D *stabilizer* color code

<!-- 
    Gauge outcomes are random, but correlated.

    - In the absence of measurement errors, gauge flux forms closed loops, which change color at violated stabilizers (volumes)

    - When there is measurement error, the gauge flux is no longer closed. End points at vertices.
        - Topological order implies a gauss law at the vertices. Total charge on sphere must be trivial.
