Many properties of fusion categories, for example unitarity, can be deduced from the $$F$$-symbols that encode the associators. In {% cite BridgemanBrownElman2020 %}, we used a all premodular categories of rank $$⩽5$$ to check a conjectural form of the topological entanglement entropy of Walker-Wang modes, while in {% cite Bridgeman2022 %}, we initially checked our results using similar data.

In this on-going projects, we are compiling such data. For all multiplicity-free, unitary fusion categories of <nobr>rank ⩽6</nobr>, the data can be found <a href="https://github.com/JCBridgeman/smallRankUnitaryFusionData" title="smallRankUnitaryFusionData">here: <i class="fab fa-github"></i></a>.

When the categories admit braidings, all braidings are included (up to equivalence).
